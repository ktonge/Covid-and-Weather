#Questions for Dashboard

##Selected Topic and Reasoning:

The selected topic is to combine weather and COVID-19 datasets to determine the effect of weather on the COVID-19 infection rate. The reasoning behind this selection is to investigate whether there is any relationship between weather and the spread of COVID-19. By using multiple linear regression, the team aims to determine the impact of weather on the COVID-19 infection rate.


##Description of the data:
The team used COVID-19 data from Kaggle, which included 1933 and 2484 data points for the dense and sparse county groups, respectively. The data included columns for date, county, state, total_cases, new_cases, future_delta7, and future_delta14. Additionally, weather data was collected for each county by day, including average temperature, precipitation, windspeed, and humidity.

###Questions the team originally planned to answer with the project:

The team planned to answer the following questions through their project:

•	Does weather have a significant impact on COVID-19 cases seen in the next week?
•	Can machine learning models be used to predict the number of COVID-19 cases based on temperature?
•	How does the weather in the past impact COVID-19 cases in the future?
