# Dashboard Explanation

## Worksheet 1: 
the first graph which measures different covid parameters globally. I created a parameter for this shown on the right-hand side as “Covid Parameters”. You can select various measures from this parameter and see them such as ‘Delta 14’ is present in the view now.

## Worksheet 2:
This area chart shows the number of new cases by day. In the title I added the total number of new cases and below that is present percent difference between days. This calculation varies day to day while I just calculated for the latest vs previous day.

## Worksheet 3:
This is the same as worksheet 2, the difference is I used total cases in this but new cases in the previous chart.

## Worksheet 4:
This is a bar chart for different states showing weather measures. I also created a parameter for this named as ‘Weather Parameter’. This parameter will allow you to bring different weather elements into the view of this bar chart.

## Dashboard:
TThe final dashboard which includes all the charts. You can change the view of map or bar chart by using the parameters.
