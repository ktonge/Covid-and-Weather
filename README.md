# Group 2 Final Project 
# Deliverable 1
## Project Design 
As a group we're looking at combining weather and Covid 19 datasets.  We are hoping to use multiple linear regression to determine what, if any effect, does weather have on the covid infection rate. 
When looking at databases, we discovered that our most immediate challenge would be determining scope of the study.  There are massive amounts of weather and covid data. We started doing research into pre-existing papers on the topic.  {I'm going to write more here about the articles we went through and the different ways they broke down the data and determined temperature.  

## Choosing Databases
## The Questions
Is there a correlation between temperature and the number of COVID-19 cases?
How does the relationship between temperature and COVID-19 cases differ across different cities or regions?
Can we use machine learning models to predict the number of COVID-19 cases based on temperature and other variables such as population density or public transit use?
